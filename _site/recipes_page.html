  <h2> a simple salad </h2>
  <img class="recipe-content-photos" src="assets/images/recipes/salad.jpg" alt="salad">

  <p> It's much easier to eat healthily in the summer. Mostly because you don't crave hot comfort food. So I'm enjoying putting togethr salads for lunch. I forgoot how easy it is to put together a simple dressing.
  <br>
  <br> Here is all you need:
  </p>



  <ul>
    <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar </li>
    <li> a pinch of salt </li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  In this recipe I used Kale, some spinach and cherry tomatoes becase that's what I had lying around but you could use anything really.

  <h2> Bread glorious bread </h2>
  <img class="recipe-content-photos" src="assets/images/recipes/bread.jpg" alt="salad">
  <p> Today I made some bread. I have rediscovered the joy of cooking recently and I'm not talking about the book. I bought a copy of Simple and Classic recipe book recently. I bought some yeast and it turned out to be incredibly straight forward to make the dough. So I decided to make some bread.
  <br>
  <br> Here is the recipe:
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li> 400g flour </li>
    <li> 1 tsp quick yeast </li>
    <li> 300ml luke warm water </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
    <li> 1/2 tablespoon salt </li>
  </ul>


  <p>
    Mix together the water and yeast, then add the flour and mix with a spoon till there are no clumpy bits on the edge of the bowl. Then put it onto a floured surface and knead with your hands until its smooth.
    Leave it for a few hours to rise in a bowl covered with a dishtowel.
    Finally knead and roll the douogh into a loaf and leave to rise for an hour or so. You can cut a cross into them with a small knife and put a bit of olive oil or butter ontop for some flavour.
    Finally bake in a 220 degrees fan oven for 30 mins
